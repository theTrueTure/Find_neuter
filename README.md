# Find_neuter
An old Python script for finding Swedish neuter for nouns.
The data was provided by Stockholm University and used part-of-speech tagged blogposts from different Swedish counties.

My first big project from last year. As a part of an introductory university course in Python.
Looking back, there are alot of improvements to be made, but I have my hands full at the time.

Some refactoring to be made:

-Renaming variables for clearity.

-Adding docstrings.

-Removing and clarifying comments.

-Shortening and removing reduncance.

-Probably more things I can't think of right now.
